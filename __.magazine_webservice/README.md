# magazine webservice 

This is a directory which can live in any webroot. The Magazine app is the one which is going to call latest.json in order to track the path of a zip file to download.

You can make other copies of magazine/latest_magazine.zip and update the last version at latest.json. The purpose of that is so the app can detect there is a new magazine ready to download and stored based on latest version.

latest_magazine.zip has a directory which can have multiple html pages in order for a pageviewer in the app to load each page.

If you have any question feel free to do requests through github.
