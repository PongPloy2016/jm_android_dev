# jm_android_dev 

This is an ongoing learning and testing of many of the fundamentals in Android development. Some apps in here require still a bit of tweaks thought I try my best to complete everything, and use this repository as reference in stackoverflow or in my blog.

- march 25, 2017. [services demos](https://github.com/juanmendez/jm_android_dev/tree/master/10.services) are going away in exchange of another repository.
